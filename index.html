  <h1>Welcome to Arlo's blog!</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Arlo :) In this blog I will talk about some of my favorite toys and activities.</p>
  <p>First, a few things about me.</p>
  <p>I am 10 moths old and my owner says I am about to get "fixed." I am about 35 pounds and am a Texas Heeler. Which is a cattle dog mix breed. My owner says I am the cutest dog ever and tells me to stop growing but I can't help it!</p>
  <h2>My top 5 favorite toys are:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Sticks!</li>
    <li>Chuck it!</li>
    <li>Anything that squeeks!</li>
    <li>My magic hat!</li>
    <li>My fried egg!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I will usually chew a hole into my toys after a short time. For some reason my owners try to throw my toy away after this but I am working on a way to hide them so they never get tossed in the trash!</p>
  <h2>Some of my favorite activities include:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Waking up at 5:58 in the morning</li>
    <li>Playing fetch</li>
    <li>Finding new spots to go to the bathroom that are farther away from my home</li>
    <li>Going to the dog park and playing with my friends</li>
    <li>Going to my tricks class</li>
    <li>Hanging out with my sister Juniper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Some things I don't like are:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Vacuum cleaners</li>
      <li>Sleeping in</li>
      <li>The heat!</li>
    </ul>
